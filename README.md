# Uber-Analysis-Dataset

## Overview
This project analyzes Uber ride data to extract insights, visualize patterns, and support data-driven decision making.

The analysis is done using **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**. SQL queries are also used to process datasets.

   - Key metrics calculated (average ride distance, peak hours, etc.)
3. Insights
   - Popular pickup/drop locations
   - Peak ride hours
   - Ride fare distribution
4. Tools Used
   - Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
   - SQL for data manipulation
