## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** Uber dataset from Kaggle or public domain
- **Content:** Timestamps, ride requests, pickup locations, etc.
- **Format:** CSV / structured data

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Load and understand the Uber rides dataset
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Analyze ride demand over time
- Visualize ride trends by hour, day, and month
- Identify peak hours and high-demand zones

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries:**
  - Data Handling: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
  - Date-Time Processing: `datetime`

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Ride frequency by:
  - Hour of the day
  - Day of the week
  - Month of the year
- Pickup location analysis
- Heatmaps and bar plots for demand visualization

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values
- Converting timestamp strings to datetime objects
- Extracting hour, day, and month from timestamps
- Grouping and aggregating data for trend analysis

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Identified **peak ride hours**
- Weekday vs weekend ride patterns
- Time-based ride demand fluctuations
- Suggestions for Uber surge pricing strategies

---

## 📷 Visualizations

- Time series plots for ride demand
- Bar charts for daily and monthly patterns
- Heatmaps for hourly ride frequency
- Geographical pickup trends (if coordinates are available)
